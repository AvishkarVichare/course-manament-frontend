# Course Management Frontend

## Description

This project features two panels: the admin panel and the instructor panel.

### Admin Panel

In the admin panel, administrators have the capability to create courses by providing essential details such as the course name, level, image, and description. Admins can also assign instructors to specific courses by selecting the course and adding instructors from a dropdown menu. The dropdown menu includes instructors who have signed up with the app.

### Instructor Panel

In the instructor panel, instructors can access a list of lectures assigned to them. Each lecture includes information about the course, date, and time. This system is designed to prevent an instructor from conducting multiple lectures on the same day, as specified in the assignment.

## Technology and Techniques Used

- **Frontend**: The frontend is developed using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. The use of React allows for a dynamic and responsive user interface.

- **State Management**: For state management, the Context API is employed. This ensures efficient and centralized state management in the application.

- **Backend**: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing robust server functionality. MongoDB is used as the database to store and manage data.

- **Database**: MongoDB is chosen as the database system, ensuring flexibility and scalability for managing course and instructor data.
